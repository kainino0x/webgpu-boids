## Details

The interesting file in this repository is [boids.ts](boids.ts). The rest is setup and configuration.

The `boids.js` file is the compiler-generated output of `boids.ts`.
For a live development server that keeps `boids.js` up-to-date and live-reloads
the webpage, first `npm install` then run `npm start`.
